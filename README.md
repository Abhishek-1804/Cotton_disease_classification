# Cotton Disease Classification using Transfer Learning

This project aims to classify cotton diseases using transfer learning techniques. Transfer learning involves leveraging pre-trained neural network models and fine-tuning them for a specific task, in this case, identifying diseases in cotton plants.

## Dataset

You can access the dataset used in this project from the following Google Drive link:
[Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TchYRgFXw4dQWIpBTx9tNv7xJOhzBZPS?usp=sharing)

The dataset contains images of healthy cotton plants and plants affected by various diseases. Make sure to download and organize the dataset appropriately before running the code.

## Models

### 1. ResNet

ResNet, short for "Residual Networks," is a deep neural network architecture known for its exceptional performance in image classification tasks. It introduced the concept of residual connections, which allows the network to learn and optimize extremely deep architectures. ResNet has multiple variants, such as ResNet-18, ResNet-50, etc., which differ in the number of layers. In this project, we use a specific ResNet architecture for cotton disease classification.

### 2. InceptionNet

InceptionNet, also known as GoogLeNet, is a convolutional neural network architecture developed by Google. It is famous for its efficiency and ability to capture features at multiple scales. InceptionNet uses "Inception" modules, which are composed of multiple convolutional filters with different kernel sizes in parallel. These modules help the network extract diverse features from input images.

### 3. DenseNet

DenseNet, short for "Densely Connected Convolutional Networks," is a neural network architecture that emphasizes feature reuse. Unlike traditional CNNs, where layers are connected sequentially, DenseNet connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. This dense connectivity leads to efficient information flow and gradient propagation. DenseNet has been shown to achieve impressive results with fewer parameters.

Each of these models has its own strengths and characteristics, making them suitable choices for different computer vision tasks, including image classification, which we apply in this cotton disease classification project.
These explanations provide a brief overview of each model's architecture and why they are suitable for the task at hand. You can place this section right after the "Models" section in your README.md file.







Each model has its own set of scripts and configurations for training, testing, and inference.
